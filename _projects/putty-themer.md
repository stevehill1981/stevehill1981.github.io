A very simple Ruby command-line tool that applies a colour scheme and font to all PuTTY sessions saved in the user's Windows registry.

I originally built this around 2016, and I was pleased to find that it still works reliably under modern versions of both Windows and Ruby. I haven’t yet found a better tool for the job — though I’d love to hear about it if one exists.

If you use PuTTY and you’ve ever been frustrated by the inconsistent appearance of your saved sessions, this might help.
