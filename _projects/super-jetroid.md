Super Jetroid is a simple game created by following Jesse Freeman’s Unity tutorial on Lynda.com.

It was the first full tutorial I came across that resulted in something that actually felt *fun* to play. The movement mechanics are satisfyingly tight, and the visual style has a clean retro vibe. That said, the game only features a single level, and the air supply timer is tuned so aggressively I’m not convinced it’s actually possible to beat!

Still, it was a great learning experience — especially around tilemaps, animation, and basic level design in Unity.

You can download the Windows and Mac builds here, or try the game online using the Unity Web Player.
