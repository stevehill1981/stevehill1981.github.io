  <p><strong>About the author</strong></p>
  <p>
    I'm Steve Hill — a developer, writer, and lifelong lover of vintage
    computers. The first machine I owned was a ZX Spectrum, and it lit the spark
    that made me want to build software. I’ve worked professionally with modern
    stacks like Ruby on Rails, but I’ve always carried a torch for the classics.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Code Like It’s 198X</em> is my way of finally doing what I always wanted
    to do: make games — and learn everything from the foundations up, one
    system at a time.
