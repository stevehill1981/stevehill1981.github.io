  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    <strong>Welcome to <em>Code Like It's 198x</em></strong>, a blog series exploring the joys and challenges of writing code for vintage computers â€” from the 8-bit wonders of the 1980s to the 16-bit and early 32-bit systems of the 1990s.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    This series is for curious minds who want to understand:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-6">
    <li>How games and programs were built with limited memory, slow CPUs, and quirky graphics hardware.</li>
    <li>What it's like to write assembly and BASIC in 2025.</li>
    <li>How to get started with emulators, dev tools, and cross-compilers.</li>
    <li>Why learning to code on vintage systems still matters â€” and what it teaches us about modern software development.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-lg mb-6">
    Whether you're here to relive your childhood, learn the foundations of computing, or just build something fun, you're in the right place.
