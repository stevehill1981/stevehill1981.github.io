Since May 2017, I've been working with [Guru Systems](https://www.gurusystems.com) as a Senior Developer.

It's been a hell of a ride; over the last 15 months, I've learned to develop in both
Golang and Python, alongside my existing Ruby and PHP knowledge.

Now though, the time has come to move on: I'm joining [Divido](https://www.divido.com). There,
I'll be helping them to expand their consumer lending platform, making it easier for businesses
to offer finance to customers. I'll still be working with PHP and Golang, but I'll be able to
expand my knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes as well; containerising applications is all the
rage at the moment!
