title: About Me

<p>Hey there — I’m Steve Hill. I’m a senior software engineer, lifelong nerd, and unapologetic fan of both elegant code and massive sci-fi book collections.</p>

<p>I’ve been writing software professionally for over 15 years, but tinkering with tech goes back even further. My toolbox includes Ruby (which I love), PHP (which I’ve wrestled into shape), and Go (which I tolerate). I’m deeply invested in sustainable software — not just in terms of energy or carbon, but in human pace and technical longevity. I care about code that’s clear, maintainable, and kind to future-you.</p>

<p>These days I work remotely, helping build tools that people actually want to use. I’ve been hands-on with everything from containerisation and CI/CD to infrastructure-as-code. I work across the stack, and I’m comfortable building apps, pipelines, and clusters — though I’d rather be writing Ruby than YAML.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I read obsessively. I’m especially drawn to science fiction and fantasy, but I’ll devour anything from thrillers to weird experimental fiction. I blame Tolkien for getting me started and Terry Pratchett for keeping me hooked. Peter F. Hamilton and Stephen King sit side by side on my shelves, which are running out of space.</p>

<p>I’m also into retro gaming and own more vintage machines than I probably should — Spectrum, Amiga, Commodore 64, and more. I backed the ZX Spectrum Next and still have dreams of making my own game for it one day. I’m building an arcade cabinet around a Raspberry Pi and experimenting with LED lighting, reactive effects, and rotating monitors for vertical shooters. It’s excessive, and I love it.</p>

<p>When I’m not building software or rebuilding old consoles, I’m usually failing to master the guitar or watching TV shows set in space. Babylon 5 is the greatest of them all. (Yes, I will die on that hill.)</p>

<p>I believe in thoughtful software, quiet confidence, and making things better than I found them. If that resonates, we’ll probably get along.</p>
