This Unity sample project was built by following the official Space Shooter tutorial.

I was really impressed with how clear the tutorial was, and how powerful the Unity system is in general. I didn’t expect lots of dragging and dropping to be a realistic way of building a game, but it turns out — it kind of is!

While it’s very much a beginner-level experience, this project gave me a solid grounding in Unity’s component system, prefabs, and basic scripting in C#. A fun little intro to 2D game development.
