    <h1>Hello, BASIC!</h1>
    
    <p>In this first installment of "Code Like It's 198x," we'll take a look at the BASIC programming language and how its concepts still influence modern development.</p>
    
    <h2>A Brief History</h2>
    <p>BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was created in 1964 at Dartmouth College by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz. It was designed to be an easy-to-learn language for students who weren't necessarily computer science majors.</p>
    
    <h2>Sample Code</h2>
    <p>Here's a classic "Hello, World!" program in BASIC:</p>
    
    ```basic
    10 PRINT "HELLO, WORLD!"
    20 GOTO 10
    ```
    
    <h2>Modern Equivalents</h2>
    <p>While BASIC itself isn't widely used today, many of its concepts live on in modern languages. For example:</p>
    
    ```javascript
    // Modern JavaScript equivalent
    while (true) {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Line numbers (10, 20, etc.)</li>
        <li>GOTO statements</li>
        <li>Simple I/O operations</li>
        <li>Basic control structures</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why It Matters Today</h2>
    <p>BASIC's influence can be seen in modern programming education. Its emphasis on simplicity and immediate feedback helped shape how we teach programming today.</p>
