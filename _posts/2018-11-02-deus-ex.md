Lately, I've been a little bit obsessed with the Deus Ex series of games; specifically
those featuring Adam Jensen. Yes, I know that the last game came out in 2016. I'm a little
behind the times, what can I say?

I've been a fan of the whole cyberpunk "thing" since I was a kid; Deus Ex gives me definite
throwbacks to Syndicate on the Amiga (although those agents had even less self-determination
than Jensen has). I like it because of the questions it forces you to ask of society; it's
a mirror through which to view the world.

Deus Ex has always forced you to make difficult choices. Do you kill everyone you come across,
or do you attempt a non-lethal solution? Do you prioritise the life of one person over the
greater mission? Do you help people who cannot help themselves?

I tend to play non-lethal where I can; it's a lot of fun sneaking around behind people, then
smacking them over the head or stunning them. Sometimes the nature of the enemies I'm facing
makes me wonder if they deserve death; they kill without reservation - should I be doing the
same to them?

So far, the answer is no. Unless I'm forced to start putting big holes in people, I stick to
the shadows. Even when the opposition are pretty much textbook evil.

I think I'm a little over halfway through Mankind Divided, and it's been a hell of a ride.
