It's been 18 months since my last post about Spectrum development.

<!--more-->

That's mostly because I'm still waiting for my Spectrum Next to arrive. It's taken a while
for the team at Next Towers to finalise the hardware - the keyboard in particular has proven
to be rather challenging - but the problems seem to be behind them, and that should mean that
I've got a brand new shiny toy to play with soon.

When that happens, I'll be picking up my ZX Spectrum development guides again. This might be
a bit slow; it's been a while, and unfortunately I still have to work to pay the bills (I keep
waiting for that lottery win, but until then...)

My rough plans for the guides are to start out with the basics, but work towards producing a
series of games, building on the core concepts with every stage.
