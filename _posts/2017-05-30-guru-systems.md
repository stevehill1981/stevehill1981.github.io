I've spent much of the last two years at Siftware working with [Guru Systems](https://www.gurusystems.com) as my primary client, and I'm happy to announce
that I'll now be working with them a lot closer; I'm joining their team.

The rough working plan is to continue building on the excellent work we've
done so far on their main PHP application, but also to expand into other areas.

Exciting times!
