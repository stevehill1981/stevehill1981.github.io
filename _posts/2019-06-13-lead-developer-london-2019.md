On the 11th and 12th of June 2019, I was at Lead Developer London 2019, along with around 1400 other attendees.

Lead Dev is my favourite conference of the year, and this year did not disappoint. I'm still processing my thoughts
from all of the incredible talks. I just tried to make a list of my favourites, and it ended up including more than
half of the talks.

This year, the majority of the talks were either 10 minutes or 30 minutes long, with only one (very worthwhile)
exception. This felt like a better balance than in 2018, and definitely better than other conferences I've attended
that have talks of an hour or longer. Refreshment breaks were plentiful, and the food was actually pretty good.

In between talks, I got a chance to chat to several of the speakers, including Nick Means and Pat Kua, plus speakers
from previous years who this time came as attendees. Everyone was, as always, super-friendly. I keep thinking that
I'll submit a talk one of these years, but then the crippling fear of making a fool of myself kicks in and I decide
against it. I don't yet feel I've got anything unique to say that hasn't already been said a thousand times or more,
but I'll keep thinking.

Lead Dev is inspiring from start-to-finish, and I hope to be there again next year.

Once the videos and slides are out, and I've had chance to collect myself, I'll write up my notes and post them here
for all who are interested.
